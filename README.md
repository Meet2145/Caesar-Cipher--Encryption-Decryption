This repository contains two Python scripts that implement encryption and decryption techniques:

Caesar Cipher:
A simple encryption method where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
The script allows you to input a message and encrypt it using a fixed key (shift). It also provides decryption of the encrypted message using the same key.

Substitution Cipher:
An updated version of the Caesar cipher, where each character in the plaintext is substituted with a corresponding character in a shuffled key.
This script allows for more complex encryption and decryption, making it harder to break compared to the Caesar cipher.

Both scripts are designed to demonstrate basic encryption techniques and can be run directly from the command line.
